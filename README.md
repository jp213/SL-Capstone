Thinkful Supervised Learning Capstone

This is my supervised learning research project for Thinkful's Data Science boot camp.

Research Goals are:
  1. Determine factors that influence the popularity of RoboZZle puzzles.
  2. Construct and test models to predict popularity based on those factors.
  
RoboZZle is a video game that can be found here: www.robozzle.com

The .slides file is an html document - a slide deck created with the RISE extension in Jupyter Notebook, and what I used to present to an audience for a grade. Downloading the file and launching it from your local machine is recommended.

The project that was submitted to the grading team is a Juputer Notebook file. It contains complete code, and a more detailed analysis.
It can be found here:
